# CPU Optimization Configuration
# Enables native CPU features (AVX, AVX2, SSE4.2, etc.) for maximum performance
# This can provide 2-3x speedup for embedding generation

# Environment variables for optimal performance
[env]
# Enable OpenMP parallelism for ONNX Runtime
OMP_NUM_THREADS = "4"
# Disable tokenizer parallelism (can cause issues with ONNX)
